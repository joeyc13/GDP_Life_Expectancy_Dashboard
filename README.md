# GDP_Life_Expectancy_Dashboard
Interactive Dashboard for visualizing data that compares the GDP and life expectancy of various countries over time.

The final result of this project will be a stylized dashboard consisting of a sidebar with title, description, a picture, and radial button controls. 
The radial button controls will select the country that the user wants to see. The resulting graphs will display on the main portion of the dashboard.
The graphs display GDP v Time and Life Expectancy v Time for the selected country.

Executing the notebook will result in a dashboard that looks like the image below:
